This website is being designed and built as a reusable template for similar portfolio sites in future.

It's built on the following tech:

- [React Static](https://react-static.js.org) + 'basic' template
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) with theming
- [Contentful CMS](https://www.contentful.com/) (planned for future release)

Dev dependencies include:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [ESLint + Prettier + Airbnb config](https://blog.echobind.com/integrating-prettier-eslint-airbnb-style-guide-in-vscode-47f07b5d7d6a) (customized)

A **very in-progress** staging build is hosted on [Netlify](https://elated-leavitt-544c11.netlify.com/)
