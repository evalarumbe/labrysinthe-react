# Musician's portfolio built on React Static

This website is being crafted to be robust and extensible as a prototype for similar portfolio sites in future. Improvements are ongoing.

To meet the client's business needs, this has now been rebuilt as a WordPress site, which you can see live at [labrysinthe.com](https://www.labrysinthe.com/).

To see this React Static version in action, feel free to build it locally.

- [React Static](https://react-static.js.org) + 'basic' template
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) with theming
- [react-waypoint](http://brigade.github.io/react-waypoint/) inspired by [Waypoints](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/)
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)
- [Google ReCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/)
- [validator](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js)

Dev dependencies include:
